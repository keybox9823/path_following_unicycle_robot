# Path following for a unicycle mobile robot
This repo addresses the work done in Lab 2, in the course Robotics at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico. The main objective is to develop creativity related to the use of mobile robots, and become familiarized with problems related to sensing, actuating, and controlling a robot while executing a mission in an a prior known environment. The work is divided mainly in two parts: path following control of unicycle type kinematic model- and detection of doors. 

Firstly, the two main parts and other methods used in the project will be described. Secondly, different experiments performed to test the implementation will be presented. At last, the results, a discussion, and a conclusion will be given.
